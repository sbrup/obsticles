# obsticles
## simple obs and tmi interface to change images in a source and hue shift it

- The commands are as follows:
- image file name: The file name of an image (including spaces) becomes a command, and when called, the image source updates accordingly
- 'hue(number)' and 'h(number)': These commands change the hue of the currently displayed image, which in OBS can be varied from -180 to 180. 'h(number) is a simpler way to call the command.
